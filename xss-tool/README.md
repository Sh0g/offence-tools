# XSS Automation Tool

This tool is designed to help hackers identify and exploit cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application includes user-supplied data in its responses without properly sanitizing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the response that is then executed by the victim's browser.

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or newer
requests library (install with pip install requests)

## Installation
To install the XSS automation tool, follow these steps:
Download or clone the repository from GitHub.
```
git clone https://github.com/EmperialX/XSS-Automation-Tool.git
```

Install the required libraries by running 
```
pip install requests schedule asyncio html
```

## Usage
To use the XSS automation tool, run the following command:

```
python xss_scanner.py http://example.com xss_payloads.txt reflected url get base64
```

## Write the payloads to a text file

create own payloads to a text file:
```
xss_payloads = [
    <scripts@example>
]
with open('xss_payloads.txt', 'w') as f:
    for payload in xss_payloads:
        f.write(payload + '\n')
  ```      
        
This is create xss_payload.txt file

## Note
Make sure to provide the correct values for each argument. For example, payloads_file should be the name of a file containing a list of payloads to test, vuln_type should be either reflected or persistent, injection_point should be either url, header, cookie, or javascript, http_method should be either get or post, and encoding should be either base64, url, or html.
## Case
XSS attacks were first reported in 1995, and have since become more common and sophisticated. This Tools can also be used to protect websites and users from these attacks.
